# EO-SimpleSaveEditor

A very simple save editor for the 3DS Etrian Odyssey games that lets you edit levels, skill levels, respec(still wip, no subclasses), and add/remove members from the active party so you can run a 6man party.

Keep in mind that changing levels like this doesnt actually update the character, you'll have to rest them so they can get the correct stats and SP so make sure you add +2 more levels than you actually want. It should be fine even its above LV 99/130 assuming you rest them right away.

I'm not a programmer so make sure to backup your save, even if this script makes one anyway.

# How to use
Drag and drop the save, make the changes you want and then save.

Options: 0-29, s, a, r, t
